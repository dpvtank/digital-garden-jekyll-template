1. What was the most interesting and exciting part of this? 
2. Why did you stop when you did?

The rush of initial discover. Of making, of testing and tinkering. But then it got too serious. Then it got too regimented. Then it required intense amounts of focus to get done.

**Playfulness had gone away.**

Rewards:
- Learning a new skill that can help me use a cool tool.
- Drawing is the ability to make entire worlds come alive.
- Coding is the ability to make things out of scratch.
- Twitter is the ability to connect to anyone and everyone.
- Exercise gave me novelty, and therefore was fun.
- Filmmaking was pure discovery and creativity, it was pure play.
- Short story writing was about imagination and play and emotions and fun.
- Photography was about capturing the unseen.
